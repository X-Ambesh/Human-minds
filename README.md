- Every choice is a mistake only the consequences change.  
- Humans like it when someone weaker follows them, because it makes them feel at ease.  
- Humans will choose whatever is easy. Even if they know it's wrong, they will take the path with less pain.
- People and situation both are powerless without your reaction.
